## Introduction
The term "floating-point number" refers to any number which has a decimal point in some place. For example, 12.3, -43.2, and 50.0 are instances of floating point numbers, whereas numbers such as 1, 2, and -4 are not [1]. In the realm of computing, the term floating point number is used to describe any sort of number storage method that allows the number in question to have a decimal point. By far the most popular floating-point number system is the IEEE 754 method. However, some alternatives, such as [], exist with their own sets of pros and cons.

## IEEE 754 System
By far the most popular method of storing floating-point numbers is through the IEEE 754 system. First invented in 1985, the IEEE 754 number system uses 3 main fields: a 1-bit sign field, an exponent field, and a mantissa field. The size of the exponent and mantissa field change based on the operating system. For example, in a 32-bit operating system, the exponent is 8 bits and the mantissa is 23 bits, as shown below:
